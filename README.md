# NoBroker---Property-Click-Prediction
NoBroker Data Science Project

We are interested in studying and statistically modelling property interactions. We would like to have a predictive model that would say the number of interactions that a property would receive in a period of time. For simplicity letâ€™s say we would like to predict the number of interactions that a property would receive within 3 days of its activation and 7 days of its activation. However this part is open ended and you could bring your own time intervals into the problem. This is the part of your artistry in data science. In the end we need to profess the number of interaction that a certain kind of property would receive within a given number of days. We cannot do a time series forecasting here considering the limited amount of data that could shared as a part of an assignment. You may clean the data, merge them, do an EDA, visualize and build your model.

This project aims to complete the task above.
